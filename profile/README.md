> [!Important]
> CinePro is currently in Development Stage. I would recommend forking it and making your own typescript scraper. PR's will be looked at and could be possibly added.

> We do have our first release but, that was done in some hurry, `(coz we don't have much Contributors)`.

> We request if anyone is interested in Contributing to join this Discussion Group.

> We want to make this project alive.
